# web-push
> Web Push library for Node.js

Supports Firefox 44+ and Chromium/Chrome 42+.
Notifications with payloads are supported in Firefox 44+ and Chromium/Chrome 50+.
[VAPID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid-02) is supported in Firefox 45+ (for notifications without payloads) and in Firefox 46+ for all notifications.

## sendNotification(endpoint, params)

Send a Push notification to an endpoint. *params* contains optional parameters:
- *TTL* is a value in seconds that describes how long a push message is retained by the push service (by default, four weeks);
- *userPublicKey* is the public key of the receiver (from the browser);
- *userAuth* is the auth secret of the receiver (from the browser);
- *payload* is the message to attach to the notification.
- *vapid* an object with parameters for [VAPID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid-02).

Note that, in order to encrypt the *payload*, *userPublicKey* and *userAuth* are required.

The properties of the *vapid* objects are:
- *subject*, a contact URI for the application server (either 'mailto:' or 'https:');
- *privateKey*;
- *publicKey*.

The function returns a Promise. On success, it is resolved to the body of the response from the push service. On failure, it is rejected with a `WebPushError`, which extends an `Error` with the following properties:
- *statusCode*, the status code of the response from the push service;
- *headers*, the headers of the response from the push service;
- *body*, the body of the response from the push service.

## generateVAPIDKeys()
Generates the keys needed for [VAPID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid-02). Returns an object with two properties: *privateKey* and *publicKey*.
The keys should be stored and always reused when sending notifications with VAPID.

## setGCMAPIKey(apiKey)

Sets the GCM API key that the library should use in making requests to GCM endpoints (in Chromium/Google Chrome).
- *apiKey* is your GCM API key, you can obtain it from the Google Developer Console.

## encrypt(userPublicKey, userAuth, payload)

Encrypts the payload according to the [Message Encryption for Web Push](https://webpush-wg.github.io/webpush-encryption/) standard. (*sendNotification* will automatically encrypt the payload for you, so if you use *sendNotification* you don't need to worry about it).
- *userPublicKey* is the public key of the receiver (from the browser);
- *userAuth* is the auth secret of the receiver (from the browser);
- *payload* is the message to attach to the notification.

## Examples

The [Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/) is full of Web Push examples using the web-push library.

## Running tests

#### Prerequisites:
  * Java JDK or JRE (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

To run tests:
```sh
npm test
```

In order to make the tests run in Chromium/Chrome, you need a GCM API key and you need to define a GCM_API_KEY environment variable:
```sh
GCM_API_KEY=your_API_key npm test
```
